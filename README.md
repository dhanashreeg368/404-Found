Project Name: Medical Report Diagnosis System

Aim/ Objective : To develop a website for connecting with specific
doctors for report diagnosis

Whenever the diagnosis of a report is required, a patient often feels a
need to seek various opinions(second opinion approach).Patients will have flexibility to diagnose the report as an
intermediate solution.
Having no prior information of doctors in the locality and finding the
same is a daunting task.
Diagnosis of multiple report types or a single report for multiple medical
disciplines at one stop.

All python Api's are routed via login_approute.py
